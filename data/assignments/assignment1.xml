        <p>The purpose of the assignments, collectively, is to let you
            apply the techniques from the lessons,
            tutorials and labs.</p>
        <p>In teams of up to four, you will be building a small but complete 
            webapp, in three stages, with specific expectations for
            each stage. Each stage will be a separate assignment.</p> 
        <p>The framework and a number of supporting technologies 
            have been pre-decided. The techniques for applying these 
            will be the subject of upcoming lessons and labs. </p>

        <p>If assignment details need clarifying, such changes will
            be made in this slide deck, and a note added to this page.</p>  
        <p>THIS WRITEUP IS INCOMPLETE. DO NOT START ON THE ASSIGNMENT UNTIL
            THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN REMOVED!</p>

    <slide title="Your Webapp" layout="normal">
        <p>Each team will propose a webapp to build for their assignments.
            It doesn't have to be "world-class" or even necessarily "real",
            but it needs sufficient complexity to be dynamic, personalized
            and scaleable/integrated.</p>
