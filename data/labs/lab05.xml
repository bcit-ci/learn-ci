    <slide title="Lab Goals" layout="normal">
        <p>The purpose of this lab is to help you explore and practice
            some of the view techniques, incorporating libraries and helpers,
            from lessons 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

    <slide title="NEWSFLASH" layout="normal">
        <p>I have split the tutorial into 3 parts, because
        it was becoming excessively lengthy
        being all in one.
        I have had positive feedback about the "baby steps"
        in the lab, but that means lots of "pages/slides".</p>

    <slide title="Lab Submission" layout="normal">
        <p>Your lab will be completed in a github repository.
            This will be your (forked) starter-lab05 repo. 
</p>
        <p>Please make sure that your work is in the "master" branch
            or your repository, and that any other branches have
            been merged into it.</p>
        <p>Dayschool students: submit a readme to the lab dropbox. 
            This readme should have a link to your github repository.</p>
        <p>Distance students: send me an email with a link to your github repository.</p>

    <slide title="Lab Marking Guideline" layout="normal">
        <p>There are ten tasks to complete for the lab.</p>
        <p>Keeping things simple, I will award one mark each,
        even though some are more involved than others.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Your Job" layout="normal">
        <p>Complete tutorial "normal05", being aware that it has been split into three 
            parts: #5, #5b and #5c!</p>
