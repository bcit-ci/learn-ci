        <p>The purpose of this lab is to help you explore and practice
            some of the view techniques, incorporating libraries and helpers,
            from lessons 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>There is no optional part for this lab. </p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

    <slide title="NEWSFLASH" layout="normal">
        <p>I have split the tutorial into 3 parts, because
        it was becoming excessively lengthy
        being all in one.
        I have had positive feedback about the "baby steps"
        in the lab, but that means lots of "pages/slides".</p>

    <slide title="Lab Submission" layout="normal">
        <p>Your lab will be completed in a github repository.
            This will be your (forked) winter2015-lab05 repo.

    <slide title="Lab Marking Guideline" layout="normal">
        <p>There are ten tasks to complete for the lab.</p>
        <p>Keeping things simple, I will award one mark each,
        even though some are more involved than others.</p>

    <slide title="Your Job" layout="normal">
        <p>Complete tutorial 5, being aware that it has been split into three 
            parts: #5, #5b and #5c!</p>
            <p>
                <i>Update ... Weds Feb 18th, 08:00 ... out of time and
                out of energy. I will complete #5b tonight, which
                will see the first 5 tasks through, and will base
                the lab grade on just those. I will complete #5c
                when I can Thurs Feb 19th, but will not expect it as part of
                your lab 5.</i>
