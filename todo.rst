- Need Mac OSX instructions
- Need assignment 1
- tutorial 1a: The directory that windows installs httpd.conf to is C:\xampp\apache\conf, 
    as far as i could see you didn't have a slide that explicitly listed this 
    (I only saw a slide for linux: /etc/httpd/conf)
- need a way to identify and navigate between slides
