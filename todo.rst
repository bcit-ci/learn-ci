General: 
- it could be useful for most slide to have a summary piece of text 
    under the slide title that tells you what this slide is about
- add "Want to know more?" button & links as appropriate, specifically in lessons

Midterm Review:

Tutorial 5b:
- pages 26 and 27 are identical, apart from the title
- pages 28 and 29 are nearly identical
- the quote field now only allows a maximum of 40 characters
- There were a few slides that were duplicates of each other.
- The message box at the end resulted having a cap on the number of characters that were able to be typed into it (before processing the quote)

The end result image is from the wrong weeks lab.
