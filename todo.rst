Record here things that probably need doing.
If anyone feels strongly enough, they can be raised as github issues.

- Feedback logging needs rework ... pseudo-csv format spills across lines of text :(
- timestamps for feedback have messed up timezone coding (all Z-05.00?)

General: 
- it could be useful for most slide to have a summary piece of text 
    under the slide title that tells you what this slide is about
- add "Want to know more?" button & links as appropriate, specifically in lessons

Lesson 4:

Slide 8: Is C## a shorthand notation for C# and C++ or just a typo ;-)
Slide 15-16: Struggling to follow these slides. more examples might help
Slide 19: Typo. Missing closed bracket in "DELETE(x to the service"
Slide 21: Regarding naming convention, your example shows 'customer' as lowercase, whilst the previous slide stated the model class should begin with an uppercase letter. If so, why not 'Customer'? Is it because you have another convention that the corresponding model's table is lowercase (are tables case sensitive?!). Also see note on slide 36
Slide 24: Typo "which males it awkward"
Slide 24: Didn't get the last sentence about including source files. Would an example help?
Slide 25: Introduced the concept of interface. Will need to go off and read about those in my PHP book!
Slide 31: Not clear about the last paragraph - what sorts of systems are you referring to and what sort of interaction are we talking about here?
Slide 36: Can you put this content into slide 21 and change your example in slide 21 to be 'customers'?
Slide 36: I think you have missed a slide here, introducing the concept of a CRUD controller. Specifically, you mention the various ways in which a controller can be asscoiated with a view and a model in the first few slides then focus on the Model class. I was thinking of CRUD as being methods on the Model class, not the controller.
Slide 38: Typo, "configuraiton"
Slide 39: Typo, "including dropping and tables" - should be "any" not "and"

Tutorial 4:

-Some portions (such as proceed button) seem to not work as expected, 
naming conventions are also a little hard to follow 
(order_num vs num vs code vs item). 
Extreme lack of feedback from prior labs, and only a single lab 
session usually taken up by github or some other topic rather then a 
chance to go over mistakes made on previous labs to improve marks for coming ones.

Midterm Review:

Tutorial 5b:
- pages 26 and 27 are identical, apart from the title
- pages 28 and 29 are nearly identical
- the quote field now only allows a maximum of 40 characters
- There were a few slides that were duplicates of each other.
- The message box at the end resulted having a cap on the number of characters that were able to be typed into it (before processing the quote)

The end result image is from the wrong weeks lab.
